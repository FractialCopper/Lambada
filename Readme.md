# LambadaPlayer

# The project will is based on:

- opengl - for rendering purpouses
- glfw - for creating windows
- dear imgui - for sweet windows
- gtest - for testing


# Project config

It is a x64 bit project made for Windows developed on Visual Studio 2017


# Setting up solution on VS

1. The solution consists of 2 projects - "opengl_IMGUI" which is the player and "gtest" which are unit tests written for it
2. Click on .sln file
3. VS pops up and you need to change to x64 by going build -> configuration manager
4. If you have diffrent version than VS 17 there are some errors to be fixed in order to compile
5. If the "opengl_IMGUI" does not build properly you probably need to change in solution explorer:

opengl_IMGUI properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset -> Visual Studio 20xx v14x (whatever you have there)
opengl_IMGUI properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Windows SDK Version -> choose whatever you have there

6. Try to build, and if there is no success try to:
opengl_IMGUI properties -> Retarget Project

## Then when it comes to gTest project

1. Try to build the project in x64 mode (build -> configuration manager)
2.If you have diffrent version than VS 17 there are some errors to be fixed in order to compile
3. If the "opengl_IMGUI" does not build properly you probably need to change in solution explorer:

gtest properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset -> Visual Studio 20xx v14x (whatever you have there)
gtest properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Windows SDK Version -> choose whatever you have there

4. Try to build, and if there is no success try to:
gtest properties -> Retarget Project

5. If there are still linking errors you gonna need to include .lib files. Go to:
gtest properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additonal Library Directories -> Add these 2 lines:

$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)....\lib\native\v140\windesktop\msvcstl\static\rt-dyn\x64\Debug\gtest_main.lib
$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)....\lib\native\v140\windesktop\msvcstl\static\rt-dyn\x64\Debug\gtest.lib

If $(MSBuildThisFileDirectory) does not work you might wanna go with:
$(SolutionDir)packages\Microsoft.googletest.v140.windesktop.msvcstl.static.rt-dyn.1.8.0\lib\native\v140\windesktop\msvcstl\static\rt-dyn\x64\Debug\gtest_main.lib
$(SolutionDir)packages\Microsoft.googletest.v140.windesktop.msvcstl.static.rt-dyn.1.8.0\lib\native\v140\windesktop\msvcstl\static\rt-dyn\x64\Debug\gtest.lib

6. Then you need to go to Linker -> Input -> Addtional Dependencies and add "gtest_main.lib;gtest.lib;"
The place where you add .lib files like that depends on which VS you use. Sometimes there is no need to do this at all.

7. Now evertyhing should build and the tests should appear in Test -> Test Explorer
If it does not work go to:

gtest properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Configruation Type is set to "Application .exe"
(Place where you change this thing may vary according to VS version, but the output must be .exe)

## Addtional tips, these have already been done and they have been placed so we remember how we had done these things:

1. Set directories for included headers and libraries. For ex. Visual studio -> Solution Explorer -> Properties-> VC++ Directories 
-> include directory and library directory
2. From the same window Linker -> Additional library directories , and Linker->Input-> and library name glfw3.lib.
3. Add cpp files from imgui folder and glad.c for opengl.
4. Remember to put glad.h include before glwf3.h. 

# The folder structure that might be useful for debugging

## player
/opengl_IMGUI - the Lambada player project
/opengl_IMGUI/src - player source files like main.cpp
/opengl_IMGUI/src/Dependencies/lib-vc2017 - glfw libraries
/opengl_IMGUI/src/Dependencies/include - there are 3 folders with .h or .cpp files (glad, GLFW, imgui)

/bin_opengl_IMGUI - output player binaries
/bin_opengl_IMGUI/final_exe - player exe file
/bin_opengl_IMGUI/intermediates_obj - player .obj files like glad.obj, imgui.obj or main.obj

## gTest
/packages - .lib files generated by gTest
/gTest - the test project
/bin_gTest - output gTest binaries
/bin_gTest/final_exe - gTest exe file
/bin_gTest/intermediates_obj - .obj gTest files
